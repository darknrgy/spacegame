Getting in to Orbit
    - from the planet surface, enable Hover mode
    - use the Up thruster to disengage the surface
    - ascend to an altitude well above the local terrain
    - engage and hold your forward thruster
    - after around 20 m/s velocity, enable Orbit mode
    - continue to hold your forward thruster and target 0 m/s for your vertical velocity using your Up and Down thrusters
    - at around 66 m/s velocity and 0 vertical velocity release forward thruster, welcome to orbit
    - you may need to periodically use your thrusters to manage your orbit

Landing on the Planet Surface
    - from orbit, reduce your velocity (VEL) until your vertical velocity (vVEL) starts dropping
    - enable hover mode
    - continue to slow your lateral velocity while you begin to control your descent with your Up and Down thrusters
    - try to make contact with the ground at less than 3m/s vertical and lateral
    - hover mode will deactivate itself upon contact, leaving you planted on the ground
    
Rendezvous With Other Spacecraft  
    - establish an orbit directly behind your target spacecraft
    - to "catch up" to the spacecraft, reduce your altitude but maintain orbital velocity
    - once your are close enough to the spacecraft, you can treat it like a stationary object
    - you may need to use your thrusters to compensate for discrepancies between your orbits
